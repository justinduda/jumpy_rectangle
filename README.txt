JUMPY RECTANGLE

A JavaScript Canvas browser game. 

Jumpy Rectangle is insprired primarily by the phone app game "Flappy Bird" that recieved a huge wave of popularity about a couple years ago (probably a bit more). I originally made this game for a homework assignment around that period for my Software Development class. On my trip back to college from winter break I decided to start working on it again as a refresher for JavaScript.

Jumpy Rectange is programmed in JavaScript, using the Canvas ctx library to display graphics. The game is mainly developed in an Object Oriented style, with a bit of functional programming (because its JavaScript).
